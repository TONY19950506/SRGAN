# SRGAN: Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network

This repository contains the implementation of the SRGAN (Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network) model for image super-resolution.

## Overview

SRGAN is a deep learning model that uses generative adversarial networks (GANs) to enhance the resolution of low-resolution images by predicting their high-resolution counterparts. This method is particularly effective in producing realistic and high-quality images, making it suitable for applications in various fields such as medical imaging, satellite imaging, and more.

## Features

- Implementation of the SRGAN architecture.
- Pre-trained models for quick inference.
- Scripts for training the SRGAN model on custom datasets.
- Evaluation metrics for comparing performance with other super-resolution methods.
