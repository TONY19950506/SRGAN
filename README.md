# SRGAN (Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network)

## Introduction
SRGAN, or Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network, is a deep learning model designed to enhance the resolution of images. Utilizing the generative adversarial network (GAN) architecture, SRGAN aims to generate high-resolution images from low-resolution inputs, achieving impressive results in the field of image super-resolution.

This project implements SRGAN based on the original paper "Photo-Realistic Single Image Super-Resolution Using a Generative Adversarial Network" by Ledig et al., focusing on improving the quality and detail of upscaled images.

## Features
- Super-resolution of images up to 4x magnification.
- Implementation of the GAN architecture for image processing.
- Enhancement of image details while maintaining a natural look.

## Requirements
To run this project, you will need:
- Python 3.6 or higher
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Numpy
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)
